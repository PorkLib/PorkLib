/**
 * Data encoding format used by Bitcoin for wallet addresses
 * <p>
 * Base58 is better than Base64 for one main reason: no non-alphanumeric characters!
 * Because all characters are alphanumeric, the data will be picked up as a single word by pretty much every system.
 * That means that there won't be any line breaks, you can double-click to select the whole thing, etc.
 * <p>
 * Base58 will not work correctly on system that aren't case-sensitive. For an encoding system that WILL work on case-insensitive
 * systems, use {@link Base34}
