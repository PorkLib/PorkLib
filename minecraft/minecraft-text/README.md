# PorkLib minecraft-text

this is actually just copy/pasted over from [PorkBot](https://github.com/DaMatrix/PorkBot)

simple utility classes for parsing minecraft's JSON text format

i think this is originally copied from minecraft's internal source code, not sure but i'll hope that it isn't and leave it as such
