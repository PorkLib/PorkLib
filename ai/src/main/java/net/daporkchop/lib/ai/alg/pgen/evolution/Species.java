/**
 * A group of specimens with unique traits inherited over multiple generations.
 *
 * A species will split off from the base once the base species' survivors of a single generation are considered too
 * "different" from one another to produce offspring.
 *
 * However, there is still a low chance that survivors will breed with a member of another distinct species, bringing
 * traits from a totally different gene pool into the species (assuming the offspring survives).
